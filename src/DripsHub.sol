///
/// The user can transfer some funds to their drips balance in the contract
/// and configure a list of receivers, to whom they want to drip these funds.
/// As soon as the drips balance is enough to cover at least 1 second of dripping
/// to the configured receivers, the funds start dripping automatically.
/// Every second funds are deducted from the drips balance and moved to their receivers.
/// The process stops automatically when the drips balance is not enough to cover another second.
///
/// Every user has a receiver balance, in which they have funds received from other users.
/// The dripped funds are added to the receiver balances in global cycles.
/// Every `cycleSecs` seconds the drips hub adds dripped funds to the receivers' balances,
/// so recently dripped funds may not be receivable immediately.
/// `cycleSecs` is a constant configured when the drips hub is deployed.
/// The receiver balance is independent from the drips balance,
/// to drip received funds they need to be first collected and then added to the drips balance.
///
/// The user can share collected funds with other users by using splits.
/// When collecting, the user gives each of their splits receivers a fraction of the received funds.
/// Funds received from splits are available for collection immediately regardless of the cycle.
/// They aren't exempt from being split, so they too can be split when collected.
/// Users can build chains and networks of splits between each other.
